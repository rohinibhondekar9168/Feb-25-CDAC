âœ… Breakdown of the Code
Declaring and Initializing Single-Dimensional Arrays:


int a[] = {1,2,3};
int b[] = {11,12,13};
int c[] = {21,22,23};
Three 1D arrays a, b, and c are created.
Creating a Jagged Array:


int arr[][] = new int[3][];
arr[0]=a;
arr[1]=b;
arr[2]=c;
The 2D array arr[][] is initialized with 3 rows, but column sizes are not defined initially.
Each row points to a different 1D array (a, b, c).
Using an Enhanced for Loop to Print Elements:


for(int ar[] : arr)//rows
{
    for(int x : ar)
    {
        System.out.print(" "+x);
    }
    System.out.println();
}
Outer loop iterates over rows (ar[]).
Inner loop iterates over elements (x) in each row.
Prints the matrix-like structure of the array.
Expected Output

 1 2 3
 11 12 13
 21 22 23
ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways
âœ… The code correctly demonstrates a 2D array using individual 1D arrays.
âœ… Uses enhanced for loop for better readability.
âœ… This is a flexible approachâ€”each row can have a different number of elements (jagged array).

ðŸ”¹ Want to modify it further?

You can take user input to make it dynamic.
You can assign different lengths to each row to truly make it a jagged array.
